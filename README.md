# klone
A cli backup tool focused on simplicity rather than featurefullness.  
It emphashices your favourite way to interact with your file system as this will only make the copy of the files.  
Its more important feature is when you make a backup rather than replacing all files, the only files that will be replaced are the ones that had had any changes, making this way the backup faster.
